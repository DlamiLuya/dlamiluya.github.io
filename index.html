                </h2>
                <p>Dynamic, diligent, dedicated, and willing to work hard towards the goal.Consistent and driven young person who is passionate about making a change to society. Dedicated, enthusiastic and loyal. Meticulous researcher, analyst, strategic thinker.<br>
                    Proactive with a focus on solutions. Attention to detail and active listener. Great at following Instructions. I hold a Bachelors degree in Microbiology and Biochemistry from the University of Kwazulu Natal.<br>
                    I learned a lot with my time at UKZN, especially being dedicated to your studies an creating. This has carried on to the software engeneering bootcamp that i am currenty studying with Hypeion Dev. I am currently on my second month out of 3 months doing software engeneering with Hyperion DEV.<br>
                    I am Thoughrouly enjoying learning software engeneering, especially level 1 which was dealing more with python programming language that I feel i gravitated more towards and how easy it is to work with.<br>
                    With my new found skills I hope to be able to land a job with a company that would not limit my growth but rather encourage me to learn more about coding and possibly persue a computer science degree to strengthen my skills.<br>
                    I am a lover of knowledge and my passion has always been with the biological sciences so persuing post graduate degrees in the biological sciences is also in the pipeline.<br>
                    My greatest dream would be to find a career where i can merge both software engeneering and the biological sciences to make the use of all my skills, <br>
                    these would be disciplines sunch as bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics. designing software that would be used in these fields would bring me great joy.<br>
